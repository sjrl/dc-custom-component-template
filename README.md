# dc-custom-component-template

This repository contains a template for creating custom components for your deepset Cloud pipelines. Components are Python code snippets that perform specific tasks within your pipeline. This template will guide you through all the necessary elements your custom component must include.
This template contains two sample components which are ready to be used: 
  - `CharacterSplitter` implemented in `/src/dc_custom_component/example_components/preprocessors/character_splitter.py`: A component that splits documents into smaller chunks by the number of characters you set. You can use it in indexing pipelines.
  - `KeywordBooster` implemented in `/src/dc_custom_component/example_components/rankers/keyword_booster.py`: A component that boosts the score of documents that contain specific keywords. You can use it in query pipelines.

We've created these examples to help you understand how to structure your components. When importing your custom components to deepset Cloud, you can remove or rename the `example_components` folder with the sample components, if you're not planning to use them. 

This template serves as a custom components library for your organization. Only the components present in the most recently uploaded template are available for use in your pipelines. 

## Documentation
For more information about custom components, see [Custom Components](https://docs.deepset.ai/docs/custom-components). 
For a step-by-step guide on creating custom components, see [Create a Custom Component](https://docs.deepset.ai/docs/create-a-custom-component).

## 1. Setting up your local dev environment

### Prerequisites

- Python v3.10 or v3.11
- `hatch` package manager

### Hatch: A Python Package Manager

We use `hatch` to manage our Python packages. Install it with pip:

Linux and macOS:
```bash
pip install hatch
```

Windows:
Follow the instructions under https://hatch.pypa.io/1.12/install/#windows

Once installed, create a virtual environment by running:

```bash
hatch shell
```

This installs all the necessary packages needed to create a custom component. You can reference this virtual environment in your IDE.

For more information on `hatch`, please refer to the [official Hatch documentation](https://hatch.pypa.io/).

## 2. Developing your custom component

### Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/src/dc_custom_component/components` | Directory for implementing custom components. You can logically group custom components in sub-directories. See how sample components are grouped by type. |
| `/src/dc_custom_component/__about__.py` | Your custom components' version. deepset Cloud always uses the latest version. Bump the version every time you update your component before uploading it to deepset Cloud. |
| `/pyproject.toml` | Information about the project. If needed, add your components' dependencies in this file in the `dependencies` section. |

Note that the location of your custom component implementation defines your component's `type` to be used in pipeline YAML. For example, the sample components have the following types because of their location:
  - `dc_custom_component.example_components.preprocessor.character_splitter.CharacterSplitter`
  - `dc_custom_component.example_components.rankers.keyword_booster.KeyWordBooster`

Here is how you would add them to a pipeline:
```yaml
components:
  splitter:
    type: dc_custom_component.components.preprocessor.character_splitter.CharacterSplitter
    init_parameters: {}
  ...
    
```
### Formatting
We defined a suite of formatting tools. To format your code, run:

```bash
hatch run code-quality:all
```

### Testing

It's crucial to thoroughly test your custom component before uploading it to deepset Cloud. Consider adding unit and integration tests to ensure your component functions correctly within a pipeline.
- `pytest` is ready to be used with `hatch`
- implement your tests under `/test`
- run `hatch run tests`

## 3. Uploading your custom component

1. Fork this repository.
2. Navigate to the `/src/dc_custom_component/components/` folder.
3. Add your custom components following the examples.
4. Update the components' version in `/src/__about__.py`.
5. Format your code using the `hatch run code-quality:all` command. (Note that hatch commands work from the project root directory only.)
6. Set your [deepset Cloud API key](https://docs.cloud.deepset.ai/v2.0/docs/generate-api-key).
   - On Linux and macOS: `export API_KEY=<TOKEN>`
   - On Windows: `set API_KEY=<TOKEN>`
7. Upload your project by running the following command from inside of this project:
   - On Linux and macOS: `hatch run dc:build-and-push`
   - On Windows: `hatch run dc:build-windows` and `hatch run dc:push-windows`
   This creates a zip file called `custom_component.zip` in the `dist` directory and uploads it to deepset Cloud.
